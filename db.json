      "text": "Hey, you don’t need to be afraid to admit: It can get lonely out there. Whether you’re on the track, in the pool or deadlifting pieces of scrap metal in the local junk yard, working out is usually a solo grind. But sometimes it’s nice to have a **[workout buddy](https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/tips-for-hitting-goals-faster-with-a-virtual-accountability-partner/).**\r\n\r\nWhile sitting in the back row of spin class or running next to headphone-wearing treadmill zombies might feel like solidarity, it’s actually closer to solitude. And that’s not a bad thing. Working out is a time to focus on yourself, to clear your head. In many ways it’s therapeutic to have that time alone.\r\n\r\nBut getting a rigorous sweat in doesn’t mean you have to discipline yourself in some dark workout dungeon. Even when Bruce Wayne was trying to escape the Pit in “The Dark Knight Rises,” he had all of his prison boys chanting and cheering him on. And that’s one of the **[great things about workout buddies](https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/8-ways-your-partner-can-support-your-weight-loss-goals/)** (and prison buddies, I suppose).\r\n\r\nThere’s a sense that, “yeah, this is tough, but we’re all in this together.” So do yourself a favor, and consider calling a workout buddy once in awhile.\r\n\r\nBut don’t call just _anybody_.\r\n\r\nYou must weigh pros and cons — and consider the most prominent prior examples. Below are some readily available options for you to evaluate:\r\n\r\nIf you’re a morning workout person (or want to be), this option is worth exploring. Somebody who is most likely within shouting distance when you wake up is going to make it harder for you to sleep in and slack off. Same goes for sharing a fridge. If you’re trying to eat healthy, your roomie will make it harder for you to sneak Ben and Jerry’s. If you can commit to a routine, you’ll be able to easily motivate each other to get up in the morning, hit the gym and stay disciplined.\r\n\r\n**Con:** If you don’t prefer the same gym. Or if you hate your roommate.\r\n\r\n**Favorite example:** Jenko (Channing Tatum) and Zook (Wyatt Russell) in the workout montage scene in “22 Jump Street.” The QB/WR duo relentlessly pumping iron in their room together — _literally that’s all they do._"
